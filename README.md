# groupme_discord_bridge_v3

btw this project isn't dead, it's completed and is good enough and being used in production, however it probably won't get any new features as I have personally mostly abandoned groupme and my friends just use it

 To install, copy config.toml.example into config.toml in the current working directory of the binary running.  
 This will sync messages and images from one or more discord channels (on the same server or not) into one groupme chat.  
 Creating a discord bot and inviting it to the server, and creating a groupme bot in the chat is required.
 
 Use a discord bot URL like: 
 `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<yourid>&permissions=537250816&scope=bot`


Running the python script could help with groupme setup though <dev.groupme.com> can do the same.
